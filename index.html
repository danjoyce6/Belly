            Many bacterial species have not been studied.  The goal of this research study was to find bacteria that could match the taste of beef.<br>
            A lot of research has been done, but that bacteria has not been found yet.  There are thousands of species of bacteria that can be found on the human body <br>
            and inside of it.  The navels of individuals across the country were sampled and assigned an ID number in the hopes of finding that bacteria.  The following visualizations represent<br>
            the results of the study for each individual including the types of bacteria found and their frequency, the species of bacteria and amount<br> 
            per sample, and the frequency at which each individual scrubs their belly button per week.
